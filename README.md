This repository contains the code produced for the MSc coursework modules at Imperial College London:

-  Computational Linear Algebra - 1st, 73%
Algorithms used to solve linear systems and eigenvalue problems, in terms of their development, stability properties, and application. Direct methods, eigenvalue problems, iterative methods + mastery component on polyfit improvement with Vandermonde + Arnoldi https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09988 theory and implementation

- Dynamics of Learning and Iterated Games - 1st, 90%
Replicator systems, best response dynamics and fictitious games, reinforcement learning and no-regret learning + coursework on reciprocity, success of tit-for-tat (zero-determinant) strategies in Axelrod's tournaments + live presentation

- Methods for Data Science Term 2 - 1st, 88%
Computational tools for data analysis and visualisation, exploratory data analysis, optimisation;
Methods in Machine Learning: supervised and unsupervised; neural networks and deep learning; graph-based data learning;
Machine learning in practice: regressions, k-nearest neighbours, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, principal component analysis, k-means, spectral clustering, manifold learning, network statistics, community detection.

- Scientific Computation Term 2 - 2:1, 69%
Sorting and searching with scientific applications from fields such as bioinformatics, algorithms on graphs and basic data structures such as queues and hash tables;
Data analysis tools (Fourier transforms), optimisation methods (simulated annealing);
Numerical solution of differential equations in multiscale problems, computational analysis of complex systems.


- Research Project - 1st, 86%
Agent-based and PDE simulations of opinion formation of a homogeneous and heterogeneous population.
Results are novel, publication is in preparation, code cannot be shared.
